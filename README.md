# Human Action Recognition

This repository contains a project for recognizing human actions using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to classify different human activities from images.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset and preprocessing the images for training and testing.
2. **Model Architecture**: Building a CNN model to perform classification.
3. **Training**: Training the model on the training dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model performance on the test dataset.
5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict human actions in new images.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.9
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras
